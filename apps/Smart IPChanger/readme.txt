Usage instructions:

To use the GUI, just run the program as normal. Enter in the server address (ip or domain name) and the server port, and hit Go. If one client is running, it will be modified. If more than one client is running, you will be asked to choose a client. If no clients are running, Smart IP Changer will attempt to start a client and then change its server settings.

To use via the command line, enter either the server address or the address and port. If one client is running, it will be modified. If more than one client is running, you will be asked to choose a client. If no clients are running, and the program is in the Tibia folder, Smart IP Changer will start that client and then change its server settings. If no Tibia.exe is found, the program will check default locations.
