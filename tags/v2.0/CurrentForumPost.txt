[*]TibiaAPI is a .NET framework for writing programs that interact with the Tibia Client.
[*]Programmers: If you are interested in helping out with TibiaAPI (adding to the library, bugfixing, etc) please get familiar with the DLL and using it to write programs. Once you create a program using TibiaAPI and publish it, we will be more than happy to have you join the team.
[*]TibiaAPI is open source and available at Google Code [[URL="http://code.google.com/p/tibiaapi"][COLOR=DeepSkyBlue]code.google.com/p/tibiaapi[/COLOR][/URL]]
